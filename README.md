# Spiking-Neural-Network-Simulations
A series of MATLAB simulations organized as homework assignments that were part of the course on Neuromorphic Engineering at IIT Bombay (course code: EE 746)

Most of the code is built on a few basic functions, which could be useful if you're trying to build your own simulations of spiking neural networks in MATLAB.

In every folder, you'll find the decription of the problems being solved in the `HW<number>.pdf' file. Descriptions of the solutions that you will find in the code are in the HW<number>_Solution.pdf' files. Each 'Problem*' subfolder contains a 'main.m' file which can be run directly in MATLAB to view results. The exact code can be found in the other files.
