# Spiking-Neural-Network-Simulations
A series of simulations organized as homework assignments that were part of the course on Neuromorphic Engineering at IIT Bombay (course code: EE 746)

In every folder, you'll find the decription of the problems being solved in the 'HW*.pdf' file. Descriptions of the solutions that you will find in the code are in the 'HW*_Solution.pdf' files. Each 'Problem*' subfolder contains a 'main.m' file which can be run directly in MATLAB to view results. The exact code can be found in the other files.
